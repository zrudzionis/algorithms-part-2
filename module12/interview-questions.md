# Question #1.
Longest path and longest cycle.

Consider the following two problems

* LongestPath: Given an undirected graph *G* and two distinct vertices *s* and *t*,
find a simple path (no repeated vertices) between *s* and *t* with the most edges.
* LongestCycle: Given an undirected graph Gâ€², find a simple cycle (no repeated vertices or edges except the first and last vertex) with the most edges.

Show that LongestPath linear-time reduces to LongestCycle.

# Question #2.
3Sum and 4Sum.

Consider the following two problems:

* 3Sum: Given an integer array *a*, are there three distinct indices
*i*, *j* and *k* such that
a<sub>i</sub> + a<sub>j</sub> + a<sub>k</sub> = 0?

* 4Sum: Given an integer array *b*, are there four distinct integers *i*, *j*, *k*, *l* such that
b<sub>i</sub> + b<sub>j</sub> + b<sub>k</sub> + b<sub>l</sub> = 0

Show that 3Sum linear-time reduces to 4Sum.

# Question #3.
3Sum and 3Linear.

Consider the following two problems:

* 3Linear: Given an integer array *a*,
are there three indices (not necessarily distinct)
i, j, and k such that
a<sub>i</sub> + a<sub>j</sub> = 8*a<sub>k</sub>?

* 3Sum: Given an integer array b, are there three indices (not necessarily distinct)
*i*, *j*, and *k* such that
b<sub>i</sub> + b<sub>j</sub> + b<sub>k</sub> = 0?


Show that 3Linear linear-time reduces to 3Sum.
