# Question #1.
Fattest path.

Given an edge-weighted digraph and two vertices *s* and *t*, design an *ElogE* algorithm to find a fattest path from *s* to *t*.
The bottleneck capacity of a path is the minimum weight of an edge on the path.
A fattest path is a path such that no other path has a higher bottleneck capacity.

# Question #2.
Perfect matchings in k-regular bipartite graphs.

Suppose that there are
*n* men and *n* women at a dance and that each man knows exactly *k* women and each woman knows exactly
*k* men (and relationships are mutual).
Show that it is always possible to arrange a dance so that each man and woman are matched with someone they know.

# Question #3.
Maximum weight closure problem.

A subset of vertices *S* in a digraph is closed if there are no edges pointing from *S* to a vertex outside *S*.
Given a digraph with weights (positive or negative) on the vertices, find a closed subset of vertices of maximum total weight.
