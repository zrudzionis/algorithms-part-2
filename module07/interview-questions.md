# Question #1.
2-sum.

Given an array *a* of *n* 64-bit integers and a target value
*T*, determine whether there are two distinct integers
*i* and *j* such that *a*<sub>i</sub> + *a*<sub>j</sub> = *T*.
Your algorithm should run in linear time in the worst case.

## Answer
N - number of keys. N = n.  
W - fixed length keys. W = 2 ^ 63 = 9.223372E18 = 19.  
R - radix. R = 10.  

1. LSD radix sort runtime *O(2WN)*.
2. Linear pass using two pointers. One pointer on the left, other on the right.

Memory *O(N + R)*.

# Question #2.
American flag sort.

Given an array of *n* objects with integer keys between *0* and *Râˆ’1*, design a linear-time algorithm to rearrange them in ascending order.
Use extra space at most proportional to *R*.

## Answer
Use in place key-indexed-counting. See

# Question #3.
Cyclic rotations.

Two strings *s* and *t* are cyclic rotations of one another if they have the same length and
*s* consists of a suffix of
*t* followed by a prefix of *t*.
For example, "suffixsort" and "sortsuffix" are cyclic rotations.

Given *n* distinct strings, each of length *L*,
design an algorithm to determine whether there exists a pair of distinct strings that are cyclic rotations of one another.
For example, the following list of *n = 12* strings of length *L = 10*
contains exactly one pair of strings ("suffixsort" and "sortsuffix") that are cyclic rotations of one another.

The order of growth of the running time should be *nL<sup>2</sup>* (or better) in the worst case.
Assume that the alphabet size *R* is a small constant.

Signing bonus. Do it in *NnL* time in the worst case.
