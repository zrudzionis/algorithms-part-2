# Question #1.
Shortest directed cycle.

Given a digraph *G*, design an efficient algorithm
to find a directed cycle with the minimum number of edges (or report that the graph is acyclic).
The running time of your algorithm should be at most proportional
to *V*(E+V)* and use space proportional to *E + V*, where *V* is the number of vertices and *E* is the number of edges.

# Question #2.
Hamiltonian path in a DAG.

Given a directed acyclic graph, design a linear-time algorithm
to determine whether it has a Hamiltonian path (a simple path that visits every vertex), and if so, find one.

# Question #3.
Reachable vertex.

* DAG: Design a linear-time algorithm to determine whether a DAG has a vertex that is reachable from every other vertex, and if so, find one.
* Digraph: Design a linear-time algorithm to determine whether a digraph has a vertex
that is reachable from every other vertex, and if so, find one.
