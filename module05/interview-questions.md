# Question #1.
Monotonic shortest path.

Given an edge-weighted digraph *G*,
design an *ElogE* algorithm to find a monotonic shortest path from *s* to every other vertex.
A path is monotonic if the sequence of edge weights along the path are either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.

# Question #2.
Second shortest path.

Given an edge-weighted digraph and let *P* be a shortest path from vertex *s* to vertex *t*.
Design an *ElogV* algorithm to find a path (not necessarily simple) other than *P* from *s* to *t* that is as short as possible.
Assume all of the edge weights are strictly positive.

# Question #3.
Shortest path with one skippable edge.

Given an edge-weighted digraph,
design an *ElogV* algorithm to find a shortest path from *s* to *t* where you can change the weight of any one edge to zero.
Assume the edge weights are nonnegative.
