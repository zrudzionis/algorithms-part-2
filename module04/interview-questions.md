# Question #1.
Bottleneck minimum spanning tree.

Given a connected edge-weighted graph, design an efficient algorithm to find a minimum bottleneck spanning tree.
The bottleneck capacity of a spanning tree is the weights of its largest edge.
A minimum bottleneck spanning tree is a spanning tree of minimum bottleneck capacity.

# Question #2.
Is an edge in a MST.

Given an edge-weighted graph *G* and an edge *e*, design a linear-time algorithm to determine whether *e* appears in some MST of *G*.

Note: Since your algorithm must take linear time in the worst case, you cannot afford to compute the MST itself.

# Question #3.
Minimum-weight feedback edge set.

A feedback edge set of a graph is a subset of edges that contains at least one edge from every cycle in the graph.
If the edges of a feedback edge set are removed, the resulting graph is acyclic.
Given an edge-weighted graph, design an efficient algorithm to find a feedback edge set of minimum weight.
Assume the edge weights are positive.
