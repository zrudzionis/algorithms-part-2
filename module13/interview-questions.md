# Question #1.
Feasibility detection.

Suppose that you want to solve a linear program but you don't have a starting initial basic feasible solution—perhaps the all 0 vector is not feasible. Design a related linear program whose solution will be a basic feasible solution to the original linear program (assuming the original linear program has a basic feasible solution).

# Question #2.
Detecting unboundedness.

Describe how to modify the simplex algorithm to detect an unbounded linear program—a linear program in which there is a feasible solution that makes the objective function arbitrarily large

# Question #3.
Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem.


Consider the polyhedron *P* defined by
$$ \sum_{i} x_{ij} = 1 $$
and
$$ \sum_{j} x_{ij} = 1 $$
and
$$ x_{ij} \geq 0 $$

Prove that all extreme points of *P* have integer coordinates (0 or 1).
